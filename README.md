# A PROJECT

It probably has a name.

## Installing

To get this repo up and running, you'll want to run `npm install` to get everything set up, and then run `grunt` to start up a local server. Mostly owing to the developer being lazy, things like compiled CSS, bower includes, and the like are stored within the repository, rather than compiled on the server.

## Viewing

By default, once you run `grunt`, the local server will be running at port {{PORT}}, with a complimentary livereload server at {{LR_PORT}}, so you can view the project [at this link](http://localhost:{{PORT}}).
